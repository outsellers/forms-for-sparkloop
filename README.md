## Description

#### forms for sparkloop: The easiest way to integrate Sparkloop (Sendgrid Version)

Why use this plugin?

You will need to do a few things to set up the plugin; however it does not require that you purchase a license for form builders like Gravity Forms or WPForms. It also doesn't require any additional plugins that build the integration with various email platforms - which also usually cost money. Again, you won't need to unnecessarily use up any Zaps as a Zapier integration is also not needed.

Instead this is the only WordPress plugin you will need to start seeing metrics in your Sparkloop dashboard.

Use [sparkloop_form] anywhere on your site, and it will generate a newsletter subscription form.

## FEATURES
* Easily integrate Sparkloop's script
* Stops spam with Google reCAPTCHA v3
* Use multiple shortcodes on the same page
* Sync with a Sendgrid contact list
* Use shortcode [sparkloop_form]
